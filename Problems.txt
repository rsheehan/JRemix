There is a problem with

using graphics lib
	window : a simple window

	shape : a square
	shape's size     : 100
	add (shape) to (window)
	update (window)

	turn : 45
	degree : 0
	animate 2 ticks per second
		degree ↲
		"window: ", window \n
		degree : degree + turn
	… until [degree ≥ 90]

Because the body of the animate routine is called in a separate thread

Now:
using graphics lib
	'window' : a graphics window
	'shape' : a square
	'shape'’s 'size' : 100
	place ('shape') in ('window' next layer)

	'turn' : 3
	animate at 1 tick per second
		change 'shape' heading by 'turn' degrees
		update 'window'
		'degree' : ('shape'’s 'heading') radians as degrees
		'degree'↲
	… until ['degree' ≥ 90]
