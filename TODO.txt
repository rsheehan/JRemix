Tabbing in the editor needs to be looked at after the "when" in student.rem.

The whole LibraryStack design needs to be thought through carefully.
Should be able to remove the stack from Runtime and just have it as part of the contexts.

Current bug - after an include block the library functions are still in scope.
It should pop off the stack.

Do I need setLibraryStack and getLibraryStack, since the Context libraryStack is protected?

AnimationBlock currently doesn't use its Context parameter. It should.

"create", "extends" and "using" should only be keywords if in the correct syntax.
They should be usable as ordinary words in other places.
