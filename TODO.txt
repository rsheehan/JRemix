Changing map keys from double quoted strings to single quoted ones.
Did this temporarily by making strings double or single quoted.
Convention - single quoted to be used as map keys only.
NO doesn't work because of apostrophe s possessives. Requires a new 'key' type without spaces
if I want this to work.

Added a "null" keyword. Currently sort of works but something like:
Abc = null
evaluates to false when Abc hasn't been given a value. Should it?

Fixing "#List {Row} : something"
e.g. from alternate line in asterix.rem
The RefVar is not handled properly.

Can I allow a line like:
	M {"a"}{3}
where M is a map and the value at "a" is a list?
and
	L {2}{"x"}
i.e. Have mixed multi-index ListMaps. An index of a string for a map and an index of
a number for a list.

Currently an empty listMap {} is an empty list. It should be either until first given a value.

The "white" falls through all the way to the blue colour

AnimationBlock currently doesn't use its Context parameter. It should.??

"create", "extend" and "using" should only be keywords if in the correct syntax.
They should be usable as ordinary words in other places.

When a library function shadows a previous library level function this should really be
pointed out to the programmer.

Add reference parameters to methods.

Error messages required
=======================
Dealing with null (NULL?) returned values e.g.
distance from {0, 3} to {4, 0} â†² ; should be {"x":0, "y":3} etc
