Can currently concatenate "⊕" lists to strings.
But this does not convert the list to a string the same way the print function does.
Same with maps I presume.

Add the ability to print blocks.

Bug - the code leaks the value of "count" which is a var parameter used inside a method.
===
leaking method :
	for each (item) in {1,2,4} keeping (count) do
		item
	"count inside method: ", count ↲

count : 4
leaking method
"count outside function: ", count ↲

leaking variable :
	create

		(my) leaking method :
			for each (item) in {1,2,4} keeping (count) do
				item
			"count inside method: ", count ↲

x : leaking variable
(x) leaking method
"count outside function: ", count ↲
