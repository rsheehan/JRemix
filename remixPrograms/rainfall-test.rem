======================
Test rainfall problem.
======================

average rainfall (rain-fall) :
	positive : filter (rain-fall) by (x) where [x ≥ 0]
	valid-data : keep (x) from (positive) until [x = 999]
	if (length of (valid-data) = 0)
		return "No valid data"
	average of (valid-data)

---- testing ----

test-list : {
	"All negatives"
		rain : {-1, -2, -3}
		average rainfall (rain)
	… expected "No valid data",
	"General sample with some negative values before the terminal value" [
		rain-fall : {-1, -3, 0, 5, -2, 1.0, 0, -1, 6, 9, 0, 999, -2, 0, 10, -1}
		average rainfall (rain-fall)
	] expected 3,
	[
		rain-fall : {1, 3}
		average rainfall(rain-fall)
	] expected 2
