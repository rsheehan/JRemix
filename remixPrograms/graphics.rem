	Shapes
	======

	a triangle :
		3 sided polygon

	a square :
		4 sided polygon

	(n) sided polygon :
		points : {}
		for each (side) from 0 to (n - 1) do
			append {
				cosine (2π × side ÷ n)
				sine (2π × side ÷ n)
			} to (points)
		shape from (points)

	=-
	Create a shape from the list of "points".
	=-
	shape from (points) :

		create
			colour   : red colour
			polygon  : points
			position : centre point
			size     : 20.0
			heading  : 0.0 ; radians
			filled   : true

			getters/setters
				colour, position, size, heading, filled

			set (my) heading (value) degrees :
				heading : (value) degrees as radians

			(my) x-pos :
				position{1}

			(my) y-pos :
				position{2}

				position{1} : position{1} + δ

			change (my) heading by (δ) degrees :
				heading : heading + (δ) degrees as radians

	=-
	Create and show a window with multiple shape layers.
	=-
	window with shape layers :

		the-window : create
			jwindow : "Drawing" window of width (std width) and height (std height)
			layers : { shape layer } ; default bottom layer

			getter
				layers

			(my) next layer :
				new-layer : shape layer
				append (new-layer) to (layers)
				new-layer

			(my) base layer :
				layers {1}

			show (me) :
				show (jwindow)

				clear all (jwindow) layers
				for each (layer) in (layers) do
					prepare (layer) shapes for drawing on (jwindow)
				refresh (jwindow)

		show (the-window)
		the-window

	=-
	Create and show a window with only one shape layer.
	=-
	simple window :

		the-window : extend (window with shape layers)

			add (shape) to (me) :
				add (shape) to (layers{1})

			(my) shapes : ; can be called by "window's shapes"
				layers{1}'s shapes

	=-
	Create a shape layer.
	Shapes get added to layers.
	=-
	shape layer :
		create
			shapes : {}

			getter
				shapes

			add (shape) to (me) :
				append (shape) to (shapes)

	Animation
	=========
	every (n) tick/ticks do [changes] :
